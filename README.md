Swarthmore College Public Safety Staffing Audit

An analysis of Swarthmore College Public Safety's publicly available dataset. This comprehensive dataset includes all actions taken by Public Safety Patrol Officers over a 4.87 year time period. Working under two assumptions, I estimate that Public Safety can save $35,242.63 annually by matching the number of nightly Building/Outdoor Area Checks to their historical nightly number of actions taken.
